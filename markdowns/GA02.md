# API Validation and API Docs
## 1. Setup /films endpoints
- Continuing with the same project directory from LN01, I created **film.model.js, film.controller.js, film.route.js** for Film Model (for films table in database), controllers (to handle requests toward these endpoints) and routers (to receive requests and apply approriate)
```js
// film.model.js
```
```js
// film.controller.js
```
```js
// film.route.js
```
